- 👋 Hi, I’m @Afterimages, studying at Beijing Normal University at Zhuhai
- 👀 I’m interested in many interesting fuctions, knowledges about big data, and nice food which should not be ignored
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python,matlab,English and so on
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...(no yet,because I think I am a little useless now,and perhaps when I become stronger,I will seek for collaboration)
- 📫 How to reach me ...Here are some suggestion, maybe, sending me an email by 1747673550@qq.com, or leaving me messagers
